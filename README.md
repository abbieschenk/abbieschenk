Iâ€™m Abbie Schenk, a **software developer** and **photographer**. I'm interested in conveying information and stories in interdisciplinary ways, combining interactive web apps, digital mapping, photography, video, writing, and other methods.

My **software development** experience is mainly in **Java**, with 3+ years of professional experience and a **BSc. in Computing Science**. I've also used a lot of Javascript and CSS, Unity3D, and done some Android app development.

I've worked in multimedia content creation, digital communications, and various roles at the University of Alberta. My **Master of Arts in Recreation and Leisure Studies** thesis used photography to examine travel as a meaningful, transitional time.
